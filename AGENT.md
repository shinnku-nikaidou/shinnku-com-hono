# AGENT Instructions

This repository uses the Hono framework to build Cloudflare Workers with Vite and TypeScript.

## Development workflow

1. Install dependencies with `bun install`.
2. Run the development server using `bun run dev`.
3. Build the project via `bun run build`.

## Programmatic checks

After any code changes, run `bun run build` to ensure the TypeScript build succeeds before committing.
